## _ Rules
`_15`: Smallest rule. Unrelated to `50-30k`.

`_50-30k`: Iterative rules designed for consistent coverage. Hand-selected to ensure efficient tasks. Each rule set is built off the last.

`_50k-250k`: Uses `_30k` as a foundation then iteratively builds for coverage using the `Other Rules`. `_250k` contains all `Other Rules` and the start/inclusion of the non-classified rules. 

`_250k-?`: Uses `_250k` as a foundation then iteratively builds for coverage. Additions are non-classified rules from my methodologies over time.
